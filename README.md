# Code samples README

When working with the code samples for the book, make sure to always open the `.xcworkspace` file if one is provided. The workspace will usually contain a `StorageProvider` framework that provides the Core Data related code for the sample apps. The workspace also contains the SwiftUI and UIKit sample projects when applicable. These projects depend on the `StorageProvider` framework and must be run from within the workspace.

The code provided can be used freely in your projects.

Usage of the code in both the book and this code bundle is always at your own risk, make sure you understand the code you add to your projects before shipping it to your users.
